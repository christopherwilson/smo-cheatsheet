\subsubsection*{Campbell's Theorem}
\wt{3.4.X} The probability that $k$ events happen before time $s$ with the condition that $n$ events happened till time $t$, where $s \le t$, is 
$P(N_s = k| N_t = n) = \binom{n}{k} (^s/_t)^k(1-\, ^s/_t)^{n-k}$.
\wt{Campbell's 3.4.1} Let $S_n$ be the event times for a Poisson process. If $N_t = n$ is given then the vector $(S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n)$ follows the distribution of ordered independent uniform variables $(U_{(1)}, U_{(2)}, \ldots, U_{(n)})$. Consequently, the unordered set of arrival times $\{S_1, \ldots, S_n\}$ has the same distribution as $\{U_1, \ldots, U_n\}$.
