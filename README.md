# Stochastic Modelling Cheatsheet

[![Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/christopherwilson/smo-cheatsheet/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/christopherwilson/smo-cheatsheet/actions/workflows/main.yml)

A cheatsheet for the Stochastic Modelling course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. Anything marked 
`Number.Number.X` is taken from the body of chapter `Number.Number`, and doesn't have it's own theorem/def/prop/lemma e.c.t. so has no specific number to 
reference.

The latest version can be found in the Releases tab or [here](https://github.com/christopherwilson/smo-cheatsheet/releases/download/latest/main.pdf).
