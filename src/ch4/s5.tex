\wt{4.5.1} Let $(X_t)_{t \ge 0}$ be an irreducible CTMC with limiting distribution $\pi_i$. The limiting distribution is the unique stationary distribution, that is the unique solution of the global balance equations 
$\pi Q = 0, \quad \sum_{i \in S} \pi_i = 1,$ 
if and  and only if the CTMC is positive recurrent.
\wt{4.5.4} if the detailed balance equations are satisfied, that is 
$\pi_i q_{ij} = \pi_{j}q_{ji}$ for all $i \ne j$, and $\sum_i \pi = 1$ then also the global balance equations are satisfied, so $\pi$ is the stationary distribution.
