\wde{1.3.1 Stochastic Process} A stochastic process $(X_t)_{t \in T}$ is an indexed collection of random variables. Set $T$ is called the index set. The index is in general interpreted as the time and the value $X_t$ is the state of the system at time $t$. The set $S$ of all possible states is referred as the state space of the process.
