\wde{Compound Poisson Process 3.6.X} Let events occur according to non-homogeneous $PP(\lambda(t))$. When event $n$ occurs it incurs a random cost $Y_n$, where $Y_n$ is i.i.d for all $n$. The total cost incurred up to time $t$ is 
$Z_t = \sum^{N_t}_{n=1} Y_n$ 
and $(Z_t)_{t \ge 0}$ is called a Compound Poisson Process (CPP).
\wc{$E(Z_t)$ 3.6.X} Let $Z_t$ be in a CPP. Then 
$E(Z_t) = \Lambda(t)E(Y_1)$.
\wc{$\Var(Z_t)$ 3.6.X} Let $Z_t$ be in a CPP. Then 
$\Var(Z_t) = \Lambda(t)E(Y^2_1)$.
