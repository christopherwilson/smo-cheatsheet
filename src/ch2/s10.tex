\wt{2.10.1} (a) For irreducible chains, the mean proportion of time spent in state $j$ is independent of the initial state, that is, $p^*_{jj} = p^*_{ij}$ for every $i,j \in S$;
(b) If the chain is also positive recurrent then the unique stationary distribution $\pi$ is given by $\pi_j = p^*_{jj} = p^*_{ij}$ for all $j$.
