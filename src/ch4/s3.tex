\wt{4.3.1} Let $P(t)$ be the transition matrix and $Q$ be the generator of a CTMC. Then $P(t)$ solves both the forward Kolmogorov equation
$P'(t) = P(t)Q\ $ that is $\ p'_{ij}(t) = \sum_{k \in S} p_{ik}(t) q_{kj}$ and the backward Kolmogorov equation
$P'(t) = QP(t)\ $ that is $\ p'_{ij}(t) = \sum_{k \in S} q_{ik}p_{kj}(t).$
Both backward and forward equations have the initial conditions 
$P(0) = \mathbbb{1}\ $ that is $\ p_{ii} = 1, p_{ij}(0) = 0$ for $j \ne i$.
\wt{4.3.4} For finite state spaces the solution of both backward and forward equations is $P(t) = e^{Qt}.$
