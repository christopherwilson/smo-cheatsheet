# Stochastic Modelling Cheatsheet

A cheatsheet for the Stochastic Modelling course by SoM@UoE

Contains (pretty much, save for some repeats) every theorem, proposition, lemma, corollary, and definition from the course notes. Anything marked 
`Number.Number.X` is taken from the body of chapter `Number.Number`, and doesn't have it's own theorem/def/prop/lemma e.c.t. so has no specific number to 
reference.
